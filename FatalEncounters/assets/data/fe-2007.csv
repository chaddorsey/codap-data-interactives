Talah later went to his apartment, changed into dark clothing, loaded three cartridges into his .270 Winchester short mag rifle, then drove and parked a short walk from Jones' residence. Talah waited in the alley behind Jones' house. After she'd come home, Tahah went into Jones' backyard, where he said he pointed the rifle at a window, then thought better of it and had begun to lower the gun when a round went off. Tahah got in his car and drove home. During his trial, Talah testified that he'd confessed to a crime he didn't commit. Talah was found guilty of Jones' murder in 2008, but the Kansas Supreme Court reversed the conviction in 2011 and ordered a new trial.

Cummings was killed when an Ford F-150 fleeing police struck his Saturn. The 25-mile chase began in downtown St. Louis, when officer Robert Lang, who was in an unmarked police car, thought the truck fit the description of one connected to recent burglaries. Several other officers joined the pursuit as it continued onto I-70 and through residential north St. Louis. According to police, a supervisor called off the chase before it crossed into Illinois, though it was disputed whether officers obeyed. The Ford's driver, Sean Like, said police stayed close behind the entire time as he circled back to Missouri on I-270, exited at Riverview Drive and re-entered I-270. Like was driving west in the eastbound lanes when he hit Cummings' car at 3 a.m. Like, 23, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, leaving the scene of a fatal accident, tampering with a motor vehicle and resisting arrest. The SLMPD paid $550,000 and the city paid $150,000 to settle a wrongful death suit--the highest settlement the department paid in 2010. No formal admission of wrongdoing--six officers were given a refresher course on pursuit policy; one sergeant was verbally reprimanded, and two lieutenants were suspended for one day.
