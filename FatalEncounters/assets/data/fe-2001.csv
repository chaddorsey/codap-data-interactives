The ensuing pursuit ended with a tussle on Rosetta Street in which Agee tried to use pepper spray to subdue Carter. During the struggle, police say Carter got hold of Agee's revolver and shot him in the right arm, fracturing a bone. When Goldie and Goins arrived, they ordered Carter to drop the weapon.
