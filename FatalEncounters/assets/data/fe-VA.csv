Walter Almond, the events leading to Carter's death began when Agee stopped a black 1997 Honda because of complaints that ""loud music"" coming from the vehicle was bothering some residents. A license check revealed the driver was wanted on a misdemeanor charge of property damage. When Agee returned to the vehicle, he asked the car's two passengers to step outside. When Carter emerged from the backseat, Almond said, four packets of marijuana fell from his clothing. Carter then bolted and led Agee on a circular foot chase. The ensuing pursuit ended with a tussle on Rosetta Street in which Agee tried to use pepper spray to subdue Carter. During the struggle, police say Carter got hold of Agee's revolver and shot him in the right arm, fracturing a bone. When Goldie and Goins arrived, they ordered Carter to drop the weapon. Instead, Almond says, Carter kept the gun trained on Agee. Goins and Goldie then fired numerous rounds, striking Carter from his leg to his left side.

Hottle reportedly stole a minivan in Clarke County and then tried to cash a check to buy alcohol in Maryland. Maryland state police saw Hottle about 7 p.m. near the West Virginia border and pursued him on US-340. The chase eventually drew about a dozen police vehicles and went into West Virginia through Charles Town and then into Virginia, where Clarke County Sheriff Dale Gardner monitored the situation by radio at his Berryville home. Gardner said he told Sgt. Jeff Levi, who lived next door, to ram his police truck into the minivan as it approached at about 7:45 p.m. The minivan overturned, rolled about 200 feet and ended up on its roof. As police surrounded the minivan, Hottle reportedly reached for a shotgun, ignored orders to drop it, pointed it at his head and pulled the trigger.",Suicide,Suicide,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B62PuBu1vKRLYkRpRWJLYk9mUWM/view?usp=sharing,No,,,,23113
