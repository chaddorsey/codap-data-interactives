At around 1 p.m., two teams of three deputies each arrived at an apartment complex with a search warrant. According to officials, Gilmore was suspected of dealing drugs after weeks of investigations and at least one controlled buy where confidential informants or undercover deputies purchased drugs. Gilmore exited his apartment and got into a blue Mazda sedan in the parking lot. According to officials, three deputies, who were clearly identifiable as law enforcement, turned on their flashing lights and announced themselves. Gilmore allegedly opened fire from inside the car, and all three detectives returned fire, striking Gilmore. At least one shot hit Gilmore in the head. None of the deputies were hit. EMS transported Gilmore to an area hospital with life-threatening injuries. Witnesses reported hearing varying numbers of gunshots, ranging from about 10 to 30; at least half a dozen bullet holes were reportedly visible that afternoon in the Mazda. Acquaintances said Gilmore lived at the apartment complex and took care of his mother, grandmother and his younger sisters. One witness reportedly said she was outside watering plants when she heard several gunshots before someone said, ""I'm going to kill you,"" and more gunshots followed. While hospitalized, Gilmore was reportedly charged with three counts of attempted murder on a deputy as well as drug charges. Gilmore died on June 21, 2015, though no follow-up confirms whether his death was ultimately caused by his injuries, but seems likely due to their described nature. Before Gilmore died, a civil rights lawsuit was filed against the deputies and EBSO (May 2015, Gilmore v Wolfe et al) in which Gilmore's injuries are described as ""severe, permanent and debilitating injuries requiring surgery, extensive therapy and follow-up care."" The lawsuit also alleges that Gilmore didn't have a gun, that the deputies lacked probable cause, and that they used excessive force. It also states that a deputy identified only as ""Agent Green"" rode in the ambulance with Gilmore and questioned him as to how many times he shot his gun, and that Gilmore said, ""I never had a gun.""",Unreported,Deadly force,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B62PuBu1vKRLNkZ3WTRiSld5elU/view?usp=sharing,Unknown,,,,14432
