He allegedly attempted to break into an on-again, off-again girlfriend's trailer, left the scene and run a traffic signal. Billey Joe then reportedly led deputy Joe Sullivan (who didn't know about the alleged attempted break-in) on a 1.5-mile chase before stopping, exiting the vehicle to give Sullivan his license, returning to his truck, and committing suicide. Many dispute these events--some people in town were reportedly upset that Billey Joe's girlfriend was white, and resented his success. Sullivan's is the only eyewitness account (there was no dash cam footage). Sullivan's actions (not calling for backup and letting a fleeing suspect approach him) appeared to be in violation of procedure. Billey Joe's injuries and the damage to the truck window were also seen as odd--they seemed to have been caused by a weapon less powerful than Billy Joe's rifle. Evidence was also destroyed. At some point, the window with the bullet hole was broken rather than preserved with a special film available to police. The pieces were swept under a row of mailboxes. In 2011, the Department of Justice concluded that Billey Joe accidently shot himself and there is insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against Sullivan",Accidental,Deadly force,http://sports.yahoo.com/top/news?slug=ys-johnsondocuments020509,No,,,,7695
