            The data from this plug-in was downloaded from the publicly
            accessible dataset collected by
            <a href="https://fatalencounters.org/" target="_blank">Fatal Encounters</a>, a non-profit
            group dedicated to collecting information about police-related
            deaths going back to January 1, 2000. The data for this plug-in
            was downloaded in June, 2022. To see the most current and up to
            date dataset,

            D. Brian Burghart is the executive director of Fatal Encounters.
            Through his own search, he noted that there is not a comprehensive
            source of data for those killed during fatal encounters with law
            enforcement officers (which also includes law enforcement officers).
            So he started this website as a way to collect data from news
            sources, with over 34,000 entries to date. It is his hope that this
            data can be used so that "Americans and decision makers can emulate
            best practices in training, protocol and procedures to produce the
            best outcomes: The fewest people killed by police and fewest police
            killed by people" (<a href="https://fatalencounters.org/on-fatigue-and-government-sleight-of-hand/" target="_blank">fatalencounters.org, 2017</a>).

            This plug-in was developed by
            <a href="https://concord.org" target="_blank">The Concord Consortium</a>
            as part of the
            <a href="https://codap.concord.org" target="_blank">CODAP project</a>.
            This plug-in was part of a project led by Heather
            Barker during her Tinker Fellowship in Summer 2022, alongside
            William Finzer and Jonathan Sandoe.
